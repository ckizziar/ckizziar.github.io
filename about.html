## About

Welcome to my little corner of the web, I'm a DevOps and cloud security professional, husband, father, and passionate lifelong learner. My career has taken me on an exciting journey through the big world of information technology, changing hard drives and replacing network switches in the early days as an IT specialist, exploring the world around me in GIS, crunching more than numbers as a DBA, and designing and building complex systems in virtual environments and the cloud. Today I focus my attention on securing the cloud and building better solutions to meet ever changing demands.

When I'm not busy working I'm spending time with my family, my lovely wife Anne, three amazing kids, and a sweet but really stupid dog. We live happily in the midwestern US, occassionally dodging tornadoes or blizzards, but every day is a new adventure.

My hope for this site is to share some useful or interesting information with you whenever time allows, sometimes that might not be too often. If there's something you would like to chat about or you are looking for a consultant to help you with your goals, please reach out to me through any of the channels I've listed below.
